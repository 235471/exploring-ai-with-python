Subject: Project Phoenix - Update & Next Steps

Hi Team,

Just a quick update on Project Phoenix. The initial design mockups have been approved by stakeholders, which is fantastic news! We're now moving into the development phase. 

Sarah will be leading the front-end work, and David will focus on the back-end. Please ensure all relevant assets are in the shared drive by EOD Friday. We'll have a brief stand-up meeting Monday at 10 AM to discuss any roadblocks.

Let me know if you foresee any issues.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

Thanks for the update! Just confirming I've got everything I need to start on the front-end. The mockups look great, and I'm excited to get started. 

I might need a quick clarification on the user authentication flow – could we chat briefly about that tomorrow?

Best,
Sarah

Subject: Quick Question - Database Schema

Hi David,

Hope you're having a good week.

Regarding Project Phoenix, I was looking at the proposed database schema and had a quick question about the 'user_roles' table. Specifically, should we be using an integer ID for roles or a string value? I'm leaning towards integer for performance reasons, but wanted to get your thoughts.

Let me know when you have a moment.

Thanks,
Mark

Hi Mark,

Good point. I agree, integer IDs for 'user_roles' will be significantly more efficient, especially as the user base grows. Let's definitely go with that. I've updated the schema document accordingly.

Let me know if anything else comes up.

Cheers,
David
